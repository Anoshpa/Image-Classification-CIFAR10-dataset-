# Image-Classification-CIFAR10-dataset-
Block 1: Import all the necessary libraries 
Block 2: Loading Cifar10 dataset from the keras.datasets
Block 3: Exporing what is inside the dataset (looking at the shape of the images,x_train,y_train,x_test,y_test and visualing the images by using the matplotlib)
Block 4: Data preprocessing (Normalizing the images)
Block 5: Building Artificial neural network (ANN)
Block 6: Generating classification report
Block 7: Building Concolutional Neural Network (CNN) and comparing is with ANN.
Block 8: Generating classification report of model when CNN is used.
